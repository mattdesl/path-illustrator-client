# work in progress

Eventually this may or may not turn into a tool for web animations and rich UI. The goals:

- intuitive photoshop-like path and curve editing
- minimal set of SVG features (fills, strokes, gradients)
- timeline with keyframes for animating points
- export to JSON 

The ultimate goal is to bring [motion graphics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L8tQyLEEZs) to real-time applications (web interfaces, game UIs, etc).
